	<center><h1>There are 3 types of artificial intelligence</h1></center>
	<h2> 	narrow or weak AI</h2>
	<li>is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area. Weak AI simulates human cognition. It has the potential to benefit society by automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways that humans sometimes canâ€™t. Weak AI can be contrasted to strong AI, a theoretical form of machine intelligence that is equal to human intelligence.

</li>
<h2> 	general or strong AI</h2>
<li>Strong artificial intelligence (AI), also known as artificial general 

intelligence (AGI) or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI used to describe a certain mindset of AI development. If researchers are able to develop Strong AI, the machine would require an intelligence equal to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future.
</li>
<h2> 	artificial superintelligence</h2>
<li>A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. "Superintelligence" may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an intelligence explosion and associated with a technological singularity.</li>
