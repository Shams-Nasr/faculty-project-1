		<h2>What is artificial intelligence with examples?
</h2>
<li> is to make computational models of human thought processes.
This is a stronger and more constrained view of what the enterprise is. It is
not enough to make a program that seems to behave the way humans do;
you want to make a program that does it the way humans do it. A lot of
people have worked on this in cognitive science and in an area called
cognitive neuroscience. The research strategy is to affiliate with someone
who does experiments that reveal something about what goes on inside
people's heads and then build computational models that mirror those kind
of processes.
A crucial question is to decide at what level to mirror what goes on inside
people's heads. Someone might try to model it a very high-level, for
example, dividing processing into high-level vision, memory, and cognition
modules; they try to get the modularity to be accurate but they don't worry
too much about the details of how the modules are implemented. Other
people might pick the neuron as a kind of computational unit that feels like
it's justified in terms of neurophysiology, and then take that abstract neuron
and make computational mechanisms out of it. It seems justified because
we know that brains are made out of neurons. But then, if you talk to people
that study neurons, you find that they argue a lot about what neurons can
and can't do computationally and whether they are a good abstraction so
maybe you might want to make your models at a lower level. So, it’s hard to
know how to match up what we know about brains with computational
models. </li>

<h2>Using AI for Good

</h2>
<li> artificial intelligence and data science, combined with expertise in environmental sciences and humanitarian aid, will help save more lives and alleviate suffering by improving predictive methods and ways to deal with disasters before or after they strike.

Therefore, Microsoft launched the “AI for Earth” program, which aims to protect our planet through the use of data science, and the duration of the program is five years and its cost is 50 million dollars, as the program publishes Microsoft’s experience of up to 35 years in the field Research and technology in AI techniques in the four main sectors: agriculture, water, biodiversity and climate change.

“We believe that AI can be a game changer in addressing pressing societal challenges and creating a better future,” says Lucas Juba, who heads the AI ​​for Earth program at Microsoft. Early adoption of artificial intelligence tools in areas such as agriculture and resource conservation leads to environmental and economic benefits, from enabling the ability to better manage natural resources to raising the level of the workforce</li>

<h2>artificial intelligence capabilities</h2>
<li>
AI acquires information through practical practices and is able to distinguish between multiple issues accurately.</li>	
<li>
One of the most important capabilities of artificial intelligence is its response to variables, and its flexibility and speed of reaction in all Situations</li>
<li>
Be able to quickly detect and correct errors, and make better improvements in the future.</li>

<h2>
5 applications of artificial intelligence that we use in our daily lives</h2>
<li>1- Social media</li>
<li>2- Determine your destination and know the expected time of arrival</li>
<li>3- Find a car for your trip</li>
<li>4- Improving customer experience through chatbots</li>
<li>5- Organize your inbox on your email</li>
